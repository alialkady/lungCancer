# EndToEndDataHub: Lung caner
## Purpose
- Build a data management system for lung cancer patient data.
- Use SQL database to efficiently store and manage patient information.
- Provide big data technology for future large size datasets.
- Develop Python-based models to predict the stage of cancer.
- Provide insights to assist hospitals in diagnosing cancer stages.
- Support early diagnosis and treatment planning.

## 1. Project overview
**Lung cancer** is used to predict earlier diagnoses and treatment planning that can help doctors discover the disease before becoming worth.
The project contain the following:
- **Docker-compose** file to launch the system and install all requirments needed.
- ***Batch processing** using spark with juypter notebook to visualize the results.
- **ELT processing** with SSIS to transform data and keep chance for other stages to modify on transformation.
- **predctive model*** with python to benefit from the data and get project purpose.
- **Power Bi** to visualize data to stackholders with easy simplification.

## 2. Architecture
- **Docker** to containerize the project with eazy deploymnet.
- **SQL server** to extract data in staging layer for future use and creating data warehouse.
- **Juypter notebook** to analyze data with python using Matplotlib and Make predictions with machine learning libraries.
- **Pyspark** to add big data technology and use batch processing with it.
- **Power Bi** to create dashboards and visualize data.
